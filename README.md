# HarryPotterCharactersMongoose
Here we use the Mongoose ORM to create a MongoDB and use CRUD.

I paired with another Node student and this was our first Mongoose Porject. 

In this project, we used...
  - RESTful APIs
  - CRUD
  - Virtual Methods
  - Instence Methods
  - Static Methods
  - Validations in our Schema
  - Mustache Engine to render the Front End.
